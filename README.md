# Microcontroller-Based-Smart-Parking
A university group project which involves the development and design of a smart parking system using the 'EA LPC4088 Development Kit'.  Software used include the MDK ARM Development Kit (Keil uVision5), Tortoise SVN for version control and Latex for documentation. Code written in C.

Hardware includes:
- Proximity Sensors
- LCD
- LED's
- Development Board

Missing:
- System was intended to have servo motors at each gate. Due to unsufficient time, LED's were implemented instead as the access markers
